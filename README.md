## Bayesian-Integration-Visualization-Tool
This tool serves as a way to highlight the effects of integrating two cues on predictions for position in both 1 dimension (1D) and 2 dimensions (2D) as well as a way to understand the interactions that occur in combining two cues that are Gaussian distributions in order to produce a novel distribution for a combined response cue that is due to integrating the other two cues.

  1D_design.png and 2D_design.png were initial designs for app, created in Sketch. 
  Problem_Set_for_Tool.pdf includes learning exercises based on the app. 
  User Manual.pdf is the user manual for the app. 
  BayesianTool.mlapp is the app tool made in Matlab's App designers.
